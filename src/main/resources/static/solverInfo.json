For Example, size 4 puzzles will only be allowed 0-4, size 16 puzzles will use 1-9 and A-G. The length of State is equal to the number of cells in puzzle, size 9 puzzles have 9x9 = 81 cells. It is also not allowed to violate any Sudoku rules such as repeating values (except 0) in the same row, column or block.",
